Project_Readme above contains all instructions and links for the Midterm Code Exam You are encouraged to ask questions about the requirements at any time during the exam You are welcome to use any online or print resource you need to complete the final with the restrictions noted below. This is a 400 level exam. These are the restrictions: This is individual effort - do not work together with another student in the class. The work you submit must be your own (allowing for the code base provided, etc.) No one else (other students or professionals that you may know or work with) may supply you with the specific code fragments and sections needed to complete the challenge features. Other than the database connection string settings documented in Project_Readme.html, this website should compile and run correctly as downloaded. Make sure you do not "accidentally" or otherwise, migrate the database to any other version of SQL Server. You must use MSSQLLocalDB. Your database .mdf file must be created in the App_Data folder. Prepare your web app as you did with the recent Dykstra modules and post the development tree on GitHub Upload to a repos in GitHub and post the link in canvas by the deadline: SAT night before 11:00pm. MTCode will remain available until just prior to 12 midnight with a 10% late penalty. As of midnight no more submissions are accepted, regardless of posting in GitHub.
